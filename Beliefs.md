# My beliefs

## Metabeliefs
- This document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe.
- This document's benefits grow in a compound interest kind of way, over time, as beliefs course correct over time, and build on one another.
- It's always incomplete and out of date.
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by evidence, persuasion, or chance.
- Making and maintaining this document is useful and fun. And increasingly rewarding over time.

## On Collectivity
- Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others
- Marriage should be legal everywhere, between anyone who might want to be married (the only limit should be an age limit)
- Abortion should be legal everywhere
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere
- Health care should be available and easy-to-obtain and manage to everyone who needs it
- Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment
- Owning a gun should require certification from a firearms officer verifying that they've taken a safety course, are free of criminal record, and pass a psychological mental health check every few years

## On Life
- Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life
- We don't have a purpose given to us, but it’s totally cool to make one up
- You can make a lot, or a little, of your life: the choice is yours, as are the consequences

## On Science & The Universe
- Other dimensions and universes exist
- Micro and macro evolution happens
- Something like the Big Bang happened, and will probably happen again
- Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them)
- The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe
- We have no cosmic significance
- Non-carbon-based life forms exist

## On Health
- We can change our behavior and habits but it requires a lot of energy
- Consistently eating well and exercising is the only way to be sustainably healthy
- Vaccinations are good for babies and society

## On Technology
- Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics)

## On The Self
- We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning
- Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious, so that it can better predict/act on long-term threats
- People, organizations, and governments will exchange privacy for connection when they trust each other
- We are all building an incomplete model of the universe in our heads and usually operate under the assumption that this model is the real universe (again, it's practical).
- We create mental heuristics to reduce the amount of energy to retrieve, sort, and select from lists of likely possibilities.
- The by-product of these mental heuristics is that we are biased at all times in proportion to the number of heuristics we use.
- We are the sum of our biases.

## On Biases
- We tend to favor the beautiful
- We tend to see what we expect to see
- Like behavior and habits, these can be changed but it requires a lot of energy

## On Logic
- Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else) 
- Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely

## On The Future Of Earth (2100)
- Global warming is real and will continue to cause big problems
- The number of living languages in the world will drop to under 100
- Coral reefs and the ocean ecosystems are going to break with unknown consequences
- Solar and wind will slowly replace gas and oil
