# My beliefs

This document contains a current snapshot of what I believe. It is subject to change and, in fact, it's my sincere hope that it *does* change over time. This first one is a little template-y, but, you've gotta start somewhere.

## Metabeliefs
- This document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe.
- This document's benefits grow in a compound interest kind of way, over time, as beliefs course correct over time, and build on one another.
- It's always incomplete and out of date. Odds are good it will be out of date by the time you read this.
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by evidence, persuasion, or chance.
- Creating and maintaining this document is fun, and will continue to be fun over time.

## On Collectivity
- We are good people at our cores who strive for connection, purpose, and love.
- We are all in this together.
- Education should be available to everyone freely, at least through early adulthood and probably beyond.
- Healthcare should be available, easy-to-obtain, and manage to everyone who needs it.
- Marriage should be legal everywhere, between anyone who might want to be married; the only limit should be age.
- Abortion should be legal everywhere.
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere.
- The death penalty should be illegal.
- Guns should be illegal.

## On Life
- There is no defined purpose for life, but it's fine to create one for one's self.
- Not knowing when we will die is the strongest motivator to live.
- Having a respect for all living things is a must.
- What you do with your life is up to you, but you also must own the ramifications and consequences.

## On Science & The Universe
- Our universe is one of many.
- Other dimensions exist.
- Evolution is evident on small and large scales.
- The Big Bang happened, but I don't know why, and I don't know if it will happen again.
- The universe is something that is outside of our comprehension right now.
- Other life forms exist: relative to our species some will be less evolved and others more evolved.
- Time is a construct we created in order to better understand our universe, and many of the things in it.
- Time travel is possible.
- We have no cosmic significance.

## On Health
- One *can* be healthy at any size; this doesn't mean that one *is* healthy at every size.
- One's health, including the definition of “healthy”, is a personal decision based on knowledge, science, and an understanding of one's own body & mind.
- Vaccinations are good for babies and society.
- We ultimately know physically and spiritually what is best for our bodies when it comes to self-care, feeding, exercise, habits.
- Habitual change is possible.
- We can change our behavior and habits but it requires a lot of energy.
- Not everyone has the same level of energy at any given point in time. Every day and every person is different.
- Exercise is nourishing.
- All food is “good” food; there are no “bad” foods, outside of those which are poisonous.

## On Technology
- We don't collectively know the ramifications of our technological advances. Some may be good, some bad, many neutral.
- Technology is not the sole yardstick of societal improvement.
- The tech industry, in its current state, is not representative of our society's biggest problems and needs; we are in early days of high technology.

## On The Self
- We construct stories to understand ourselves, establish identity, and seek meaning.
- Many of the stories we have inside ourselves are not our own, but have been brought in from others.
- Some of the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves may be false.
- Not all of our stories are in our own voices.
- The body, mind, spirit, heart, and gut are not real components of the self, but can be a useful construct to aid in understanding.
- Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious, so that it can better predict/act on long-term threats.
- We are all building an incomplete model of the universe in our heads and usually operate under the assumption that this model is the real universe.
- We create mental heuristics to reduce the amount of energy to retrieve, sort, and select from lists of likely possibilities.
- The by-product of these mental heuristics is that we are biased at all times in proportion to the number of heuristics we use.
- We are the sum of our biases.

## On Biases
- We favor the beautiful.
- We tend to see what we expect to see.
- Our biases can be changed, but it requires a lot of energy and this cost escalates over time.

## On Logic
- Logic is a useful construct for understanding.
- Many things are not logical, even though we seek out logic in many things.
- Relying solely on logic is not practical.

## On The Future Of Earth (2100)
- Global warming is real and will continue to cause big problems.
- Weather will escalate in intensity, and seasons as we knew them will start to blur more and more.
- Many species will die out, breaking ecosystems, and creating unknown consequences.
- Many of the foods we take for granted today will not be around.
- Energy will primarily come from clean sources.
- Collective health levels will improve, but not a very fast pace.
- We will have passed our curiosity phase with technology and have begun to use it to truly improve quality of life.
- We will be a spacefaring species, but not nearly as far out as I would have hoped.
